> [!TIP]
> - Some ISPs/DNS block access to our domains. You can bypass this by enabling [DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/encrypted-dns-browsers/) in your browser.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.
> - Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.
> - Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.
